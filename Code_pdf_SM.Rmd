knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Important Definitions

Options, Futures, Swaps, Bonds,...etc


```{r cars}
summary(cars)

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
